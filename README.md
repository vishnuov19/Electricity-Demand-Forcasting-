# Electricity-Demand-Forcasting-

This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using time-series and machine learning models. Accurate demand forecasting helps utilities and grid operators plan better and optimize resources.

Features :
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Time-series forecasting techniques
Machine learning models for prediction
Performance evaluation of models

Tech Stack :
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.)
